Database is a class which manages information stored in binary file. 
There are methods that show, search, add, get and delete records stored 
in database ( binary file ). Class is designed to work with a record 
class which containes information like: name, surname and age.

Future work will provide a more universal Database class, where it will 
be allowed to work with other records. Also there will be a main.cpp 
file to ilustrate how everything works.
